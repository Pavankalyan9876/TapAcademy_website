        <p style="margin-top: -1%;padding-bottom: 2%;margin-left: 1%;">
            The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability. Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems
            is one of the main factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in
            support for multithreading and security features. In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use. Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to
            be a widely used language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike. Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that
            make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications. There are many useful classes and functions in Java’s standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more
            capability.

        <h1 style="margin-top: -1%;margin-left: 1%;">What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: -1%;padding-bottom: 2%;margin-left: 1%;">A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers,
            APIs, and frameworks, among others. Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project. In order to
            generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the
            development process. In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and PHP. To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
            The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer. The full-stack developer may make sure that all
            parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack
            developers are in high demand in the software development sector.
